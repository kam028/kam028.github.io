## Capstone Project: Who Tells the Transgender Story?

This capstone project examines how transgender people are portrayed in U.S. news media and how those narratives shape public opinion and policy debates. Using more than 160,000 U.S.-linked news articles from 2021–2025, the project analyzes media tone, themes, geographic patterns, and news outlets to understand where and how negative framing concentrates.

An interactive Tableau dashboard allows non-technical users to explore trends in coverage over time and across regions, while statistical modeling and machine-learning techniques identify the themes and information environments most strongly associated with hostile coverage.
